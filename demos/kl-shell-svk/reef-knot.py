This example considers a simplified variant of the problem from 
Section 4.4.3 of the paper

  http://www.public.iastate.edu/~jmchsu/files/Kamensky_et_al-2017-CMAME.pdf

in which a nonlocal contact formulation---arguably a form of peridynamics---is 
used to penalize interpenetration of shell structures.  The required 
shell structure geometry, in the format of a Rhino T-spline (although it 
is in fact only two B-spline patches) is available (compressed) here:

  https://www.dropbox.com/s/irdhyral91mmock/knot.iga.tgz?dl=1

(Credit to Fei Xu for designing this geometry, using the Rhino 3D CAD 
software.)  While the contact formulation is largely orthogonal to IGA, and
can be reused mutatis mutandis for FE analysis, this demo illustrates 
the robustness of the K--L shell formulation using $C^1$ displacements.  

For simplicity, we have omitted the singular kernel, adaptive time stepping,
and specialized nonlinear solver of the cited reference, and just empirically 
selected a sufficiently-large penalty and sufficiently-small time step for the 
simulation to reach a steady state without structural self-intersection or
divergence of the basic Newton iteration.  However, due to the choice of this
naive nonlinear solver and "worst-case" uniform time step, the simulation 
takes several hours on a modern workstation to reach an interesting 
configuration.  

The implementation here relies on a number of seemingly-fragile assumptions
regarding the ordering of DoFs in mixed function spaces, as pointed out in
the comments; we invite any suggestions for more robust indexing schemes.
